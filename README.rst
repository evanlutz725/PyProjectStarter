PyProjectStarter is a program that is designed to create the files and directories
necessary for a professional project. The program takes two command line arguments:
1: the name of the project with a full file path.
2: the name of the main directory where the programs and functions file will be held.

This program is only intended to run on Debian based Linux distributions. This is a
python script for something that could have very well been a Bash script instead,
but isn't.

The main purpose of this program is to be something that saves me time when starting
a new project.

The default license is the GNU Public License. Any other license of your choosing would
need to be changed on your own. For my public code, this is the only one I use.
